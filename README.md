# Anaximander

## The Application

This application builds a basic database dictionary template as an HTML document by parsing an existing database. There are other, more mature tools ([SchemaSpy](https://schemaspy.org/), [tbls](https://github.com/k1LoW/tbls/tree/main))

The application is written in Python and uses Flask to display the document. Project is a **Work In Progress**.

Current version only works with Postgres.

The sample configuration and result files are for the Adventure Works database ported to Postgres using [ Docker Adventureworks for Postgres](https://github.com/glaubercini/docker-adventureworks-for-postgres).

## The Name
Why Anaximander? Anaximander was a Greek philosopher who allegedly was the first to draw a map of the inhabited world. This project does not draw a map becasue today we have Google Maps.
